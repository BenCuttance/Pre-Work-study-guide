## Usage

By having sections designated to the four major code types (HTML, CSS, GIT, JavaScript) that will be discussed in the bootcamp information can be stored in relevant areas and accessed quickly when needed. 
This project also doubled as a starting point to learn code. This project helped showcase how HTML builds the framework for a web application. CSS develops and is sued to define the style within a web application. Javascript adds code to make websites interactive, and how Git is used to interact with the working repository. 
By using the console within the web application the working JavaScript can be observed.
